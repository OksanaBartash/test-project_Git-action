Responsive Landing Page with Parallax Effect

This is a "Thanks Page" that allows you to express gratitude to visitors of your site.

In developing this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and managed the code through a Git repository. I also followed a design model from Figma to guide the coding process. To optimize website performance, I compressed all images.

The structure is fully responsive, adapting from mobile to desktop versions. It ensures proper display on tablets and other devices, with adaptive adjustments for images and text.

The work on the project took approximately up at 6 hours.
